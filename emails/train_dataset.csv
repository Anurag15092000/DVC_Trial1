erisk interview vince may inteersted following interview appeared erisk com last friday rick buy comments real options taken context yann bonduelle leads person team london applies decision analytics real options theory dilemmas ranging valuing biotechnology product deciding whether kill internet financial services business talks rob jameson whether theoretical approach risky decision making really helps businesses day day balancing risk reward yann holds ph degree engineering economic systems department stanford university studied apply engineering decision design analysis wider economic social business issues worked consultant applying decision analysis methodologies problems included consumer decision making innovative products electrical vehicles joining team partner written widely application real options particularly fields life sciences technology e business special interest relationship risk assessment validation risk data financial valuation would sum approach business decision analytics projects set help businesses face massive uncertainties kind decision analysis helps people explore problems redesign decision making process increase chance making right choices example imagine biotechnology company decide whether put sale enter strategic relationship continue go alone options lead value enhancing value destroying scenarios work client firstly understand challenge assumptions associated likely business development scenarios secondly help identify decisions would help protect increase value technology company quantifying technical regulatory commercial risks sometimes challenge technology intensive fields however found managers often scientists quite willing describe main sources risk assess probability risky event may may occur kind risky decision making relate real options valuation say value asset decide might use means form opinion value asset must explore important decisions likely face significant impact value asset decision analysis helps define business problem uncover stream inter related choices effect real options example company trying decide whether invest risky project option pull plug investment early stage pilot project gives poor showing real option reduces riskiness increases potential value original business plan real options decision analysis really close one another believe real options valuations find decision analysis useful mean often decision analysis help managers identify key risks strategic decision attach weights show clearly interact many companies risk discovery valuable part exercise real options theory criticised recently well realistic practical approach valuation important hold unrealistic hopes real options approach valuation exciting methodology also sometimes reasonable way tackling practical problem example firm sells asset firm might make independent valuation asset legal corporate governance reasons many businesses today assets simply valued traditional ways difficult link cashflows cashflows might exist business novel might hidden respects real options analysis much closer reality traditional valuation exactly classic way valuing future business base calculation single discounted cashflow projected activity really take account way scenarios change fact managers react situations unfold mentioned earlier option kill project business early point upside pilot project yields exciting results might allow invest quickly reach revenue generating position much shorter time original business plan allows value future business really need look cashflows might arise number scenarios realistic project gets green light bet managers taking kind decision ground time challenging part mapping decision analysis tree modelling links variables decision tree something particular strengths also tricky know worthwhile add detail better draw back recent erisk interview rick buy chief risk officer enron said two years enron experimented real options concept found limited zero use slight air cynicism real options businesses today strange enron would profess attitude years ago widely reported used real option valuation support profitable purchase decision apparently bought cheaply older generators us generated electricity high cost knew could mothball year switch electricity prices sufficiently high nevertheless customer point view might much hype methodology one problem application real options technology perhaps many people trying tweak reality conform perfect model better aim something pragmatic clearly improves decisions time one pharmaceutical company worked recently worked together improve valuation analyses moving single discounted cash flow methodology one took account rather small set business scenarios would shocked academics consultants undeniable improvement original approach think financial institutions picking field applied energy industry years might something relative stability banking world recently relatively high margins banking lines enjoyed also industries energy pharmaceuticals tend people engineering science background dynamic modelling decisions based methodologies originally dreamed help engineers design electrical electronic systems approach quite distinct black scholes options analyses banking world familiar black scholes approach difficult apply real options context everything depends assumptions put black scholes model real options approach hand sense way modelling assumptions explicitly banks adopting thinking particularly terms using decision analysis pinpoint risks identify value enhancing decisions using real options methodologies sort wheat chaff speculative investments mean internet investments recently worked major dutch bank arrived late internet game made considerable number investments even b b business models questions marks hanging many b c businesses already water wanted work investments might contain real value situation case ranking priorities helping bank make sense could turn decision making chaos rather sophisticated valuation case whether internet investment killed problem whether continued funding take priority budget demands major upgrades existing businesses practical questions answered somehow areas financial institutions seem accessible approach yes example think help work value associated various approaches marketing new bank business line moment many banks chasing high net worth individuals always clear kind individual particular bank decide pursue bank might regional industry advantage already one particular area example music business people churn rate associated kind customer profitability associated customer segment time cost benefits advantages bank sector outweigh disadvantages weighing kind complex problem one thing leads depends another decision real options analysis good way rigorously backtesting validating real options valuations honesty really problem time option exercised many variables surrounding changed difficult compare original analysis things turn however value analysis comes final number value asset x also providing thorough process outsider point view understanding sources value short bit clearer thinking real options important rarely cited communications shareholders equity analysts battle still convince companies use real option valuations significant part internal analysis even major companies oil gas pharmaceutical sectors ideas taken root internally seems lot reluctance use external communication working analysts understand better need move things next step riskiness business terms major strategic dilemmas faces relate share value capital structure big question related work colleagues optimal debt equity capital structure gearing corporation turn arises likely revenue cost volatilities business volatile business less gearing sustain higher cost capital work touches sense exercising many specific real options allow firm change nature thus also risk profile one classic example pharmaceutical industry host different kinds companies service industry big pharma companies smaller biotechnology startups run mill contract research organisations contract research organisation often operating within competitive environment relatively risks invest drug development also thin margins fact companies used skills knowledge developed become much substantial profitable healthcare companies various kinds example company exercising real options lie within skills assets transform identity rob jameson erisk,0

expected use threat endless appeals courts possible ballot initiative november keep pressure parent companies pay share utility debt well limit scope rate hikes davis hopes court ruling favor utilities would provide political cover needs pass rate hikes california consumers avoid utility bankruptcy davis walking fine line consumer advocacy groups ballot initiative november challenge expected court ordered rate hikes could disastrous investor confidence state legislation bail bill ablx heard several hours senate appropriations yesterday issues still remain regarding tiered rate structure specifically communities harsh climates however bill received support almost everyone including consumer groups bill expected pass sometime today tim gage ca director finance said davis supports provisions ablx expected sign bill abl x heard assembly yesterday expected hear today committee hearings monday dwr testified spent spending day spot market buy power according sources direct access governor davis going court battle discussed viewed excellent opportunity settlement davis recognizes expected court ruling cpuc case likely authorize utilities increase rates charged california rate payers despite ruling state government ability delay eventual reward order long enough cripple two utilities unless come terms thus davis believes california consumers avoid getting hit higher electricity charges plans use threat appeal possible ballot initiative limit amount rate hikes plan exempt lowest income smallest consumers rate increase concentrate rate increases among consumers using baseline usage rate gaining serious momentum last night sacramento would still hit one half consumers since baseline set average consumption progressive politically important sense making work would require solving minor crisis erupted last night pg e admitted stopped reading electricity meters many customers estimating bills based previous usage rates company defense laid meter readers conserve cash met widespread derision consumer advocates pointed estimation policy conveniently allowed company charge despite serious efforts californians use less electricity every time think moment utilities embarrass something like happens one legislator moaned long term contracts second key keeping eventual rate increases lies negotiations almost complete first wave long term power buying contracts davis initiated earlier month first wave contracts announced perhaps early today surprisingly positive according officials talks got series good offers initial proposals good ones one official told source idea announce results first contract talks good guys go back others say want terms think eventually shake loose lot supply strategy bankruptcy new dynamics improved market

accelerated payment feb believe sense optimism given even credible boost court case front us district judge ronald w lew los angeles likely mushroom kind political cover elected officials make settlement possible end next week latest fact without political cover would impossible square various circles crisis audit results ballot initiatives markets bush administration officials perhaps utility companies underweighting possibility citizens groups launch successful ballot initiative fall l bring electricity generation back state control threat proposition initiative mounted two audits utility companies ordered california public utilities commission released last hours confirmed two seriously damaging points warning since mid january first audit socal edison confirmed billion debt utility claims owes energy suppliers actually owed corporate holding structure generates sells power second confirmed edison electric paid nearly billion profits holding company used money buy back stock increase dividends effort keep stock price even going debt issuing binge audit pg e released late last night even damaging pg e management sharply criticized poor decisions failing react clear warning signs approaching energy crisis making deep spending cuts including scaling back management salaries auditors also questioned utility decision funnel billion profits since deregulation coffers parent holding company used cash mostly pay dividends buy back stocks basically took money ran state senate speaker burton put yesterday appears governor gray davis grudging acceptance reality actually highly evolved effort produce solution provides enough rate hikes taxpayer subsidy help solve current crisis without triggering new far damaging burst populist outrage among voter base still thinks utility companies basically making doubt use money socal edison debts owes perfectly legal keeping spirit deregulation law irrelevant popular political terms political cover potentially afforded court case discussed audits would make settlement extremely difficult keeping anger exploding ballot initiative fall key understanding complex game davis advisers senior legislators playing ballot initiative would potential disaster since would almost certainly aimed establishing full public control electric utilities even state utilities successfully challenged initiative court would years victory clear would freeze new private investment prolonged period something california afford businesses would moving new ones failing relocate court battle thus legislators listening horror hear ugly details court case los angeles socal edison pg e likely win mid february court likely grant two utilities billion relief cost would fall immediately shoulders consumers would see bills rise least california politicians could see emergence one thing everyone needed since start extended drama political cover davis rely political negotiating skills pressure parent companies utilities pass something less full billion debt pg e socal edison already round one legal battle designed let raise electricity rates enough recover debt accumulated since august last year puc refused let raise prices even electricity prices soared court said deregulation law crystal clear two utilities repaid called stranded costs free begin charging whatever needed charge consumers cover cost acquiring power although utilities case judge stayed order february th state government request deadline approaches intense new negotiating round way one hand political officials know ultimate political cover higher electric prices courts made hand also know immediate full compliance court order would force electricity rates top natural gas bills soared since last year utility companies playing card aggressively negotiations scope shape final bailout wait court puts order effect mid february even bankruptcy emerge quickly easily one tactic state political officials using order force settlement

examples energy related professors good part great deal practical industry experience guess reason decreased participation program would probably say professors ronn titman great known technical quantitative students prefer less technical professors classes limiting energy industry also fact class meets hours twice week may appealing things imagine drop enrollment especially understand every

given people industry promote class within business school felt like ut poor job internally students promoting class ross mesquita mba class energy finance taken fall honest great majority coursework energy specific energy applications presented seemed like general finance questions reworded include energy lingo good speakers part feel like hours class enough energy focus assumed would get better
